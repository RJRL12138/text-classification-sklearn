# text-classification-sklearn
 Comparing different machine learning methods on text classification task with reviews data
<br>
<br>
For this project, the dataset was collected from Google play Store Reviews with Kaggle.<a> https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google- play-store-apps#googleplaystore_user_reviews.csv</a> This file contains the first 'most relevant' 100 reviews for each app. Each review text has been pre-processed and attributed with labels, Positive, Negative and Neutral.<br>
As the state-of-art in text classification, the deep learning algorithms win the first prize like RNN, LSTM, etc. In our project, this project will only apply and compare some basic machine learning algorithms.<br>
For this task we will compare some algorithms from different types. We have SVM from linear, Decision Tree from tree-based model, K-Nearest Neighbors from distance-based model, RandomForest from ensemble model and Naive Bayes model.<br>
As evaluation, This project used Confusion Matrix and accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score.<br>
For model selection, applying Paired t-test and Friedman's test.
